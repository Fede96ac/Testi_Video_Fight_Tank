 
Hello everyone, welcome to our underwater world, I am Sharin.
Today we are starting a new path, and to follow it we will need some wood… A lot of wood.
We will try to create a support for aquariums that are a bit ... economics ... curious.
 Ah, it's important to point out that no tools were mistreated during the shoot ... maybe
But enough talking, it's the time of the chainsaw.

This walnut trunk has a beautiful shape. Now it is really important to remove the bark and then we recommend proceeding with drying to remove the moisture. This process can take years! We tried to give it a little boost

We placed the wood above the embers to try to reduce humidity as much as possible. We left the wood for about 24 hours, we hope it worked!
Well, once dried, the wood is ready to be painted. Obviously we have prepared several supports but first a moment of pause. Better not work hungry though!

This color doesn't drive me crazy but the project is cheap and it's too late to change by now.

After the commercial break we can start deciding the shape of our path. Once decided, we can start assembling it. To join the pieces of wood, we can use screws. We first proceed by making a hole a countersink and finally we can screw. We have drilled the bottom for a better aesthetic
Now all that remains is to repeat the step for the rest of the project

The next step is to prepare a tray. We used one meter long laths and reused drawer bottoms from a well-known Swedish company. No partnerships on the channel!
The process is extremely simple. How to make a low cost tray. To measure. Cut. Use nails. Many nails!


As a last step we have made the tray more resistant. We used glue, but the best choice is silicone but… did I mention that the project was cheap?
And finally my favorite color again ...

Lastly, all that remains is to overlap everything in layers like an onion.
A mat to reduce vibrations. The tray. The path. And finally the three tanks without filters. In the next video we will show you how to make one of those. I wait for you! See you all from Gaia
